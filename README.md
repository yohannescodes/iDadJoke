iDadJoke

Right on the eve of Programmer's Day, I posted a little something about what you can give to a programmer as a gift. I wrote it as a joke, but my cool cousin (Feven Behailu) took it seriously and gifted me with the money to buy an extra monitor/display and an ergonomics chair. I couldn't believe it. I thanked her and appreciated what she did and thought if I could build her a fun iOS app to remember me.

That's when iDadJoke came to development. iDadJoke is an app that lets you smile and have fun with your daily dose of dad jokes. The app fetches dad jokes from an API and lets you see up to 50 jokes in 24 hours. This is entirely made for her. And I tried to make it friendly as I can. I wanted it to feel familiar, feminine, and also simplistic.

The best Programmer's Day I ever had in my entire years of programming.
